## Problem Statement
Financial institutions face credit risk when borrowers fail to repay loans. This analysis aims to identify patterns and risk indicators that contribute to loan defaults.

## Tools
- SQL / MySQL Workbench
- Power BI
- Excel
  
## Approach
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
2. Exploratory analysis to identify default patterns
3. Visualization of key factors
4. Insights and recommendations

## Key Insights
• Highest default rates observed in the 20K–40K income segment.
• Loans above 100K show elevated default risk (28%).
• Unemployed borrowers and lower education levels exhibit higher risk.
• Borrowers under 25 demonstrate significantly higher default rates.

## Recommendations
1. Strengthen screening for low-income and high loan amount applicants.
2.  Emphasize employment stability in credit evaluations.
3.  Provide targeted financial education for high-risk segments.
4.  Incorporate age-based risk considerations into approval policies.
